# Sonic Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

How to deploy on Sonic testnet
```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts --network sonic
```
